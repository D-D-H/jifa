# Heap Dump Analysis

## Introduction

Heap Dump analysis is a technique used to diagnose memory-related issues in Java applications. When applications
experience memory leaks, out-of-memory errors, or other memory problems, Heap Dump analysis provides detailed
information about object allocations, reference relationships, and memory usage in the heap memory.

By generating a Heap Dump file, we obtain a complete memory snapshot of the application at a specific point in time.
This snapshot includes all currently existing objects and their reference relationships. Using a Heap Dump analysis
tool, we can delve into the objects in the heap memory and identify those that may be causing memory issues.

During Heap Dump analysis, we can examine the number, size, class information of objects, and their reference
relationships. We can analyze the lifecycle of objects, identify objects that are held in memory for a prolonged period,
potentially causing memory leaks. We can also inspect the reference chains between objects to find potential circular
references or unintended references that prevent memory from being freed.

Heap Dump analysis also helps us identify situations of high memory usage. We can examine the distribution of objects in
the heap memory and identify object types that consume a significant amount of memory. This helps us optimize memory
usage, reduce memory footprint, and improve the performance and stability of the application.

In summary, Heap Dump analysis is a powerful tool that assists developers in diagnosing and resolving memory-related
issues in Java applications, including memory leaks, out-of-memory errors, and high memory usage. By analyzing objects
and reference relationships in the heap memory, we can identify potential issues and take appropriate optimization
measures.

## Views

### Overview

This view provides an overall view of the heap dump file, including information on the heap size, usage, and the
number of objects. It helps to understand the overall state of the heap and quickly identify potential issues.

### Leak Suspects

This view helps identify potential memory leaks by analyzing the heap dump file. It identifies objects
that may be causing memory leaks and provides detailed information to aid in locating and resolving the issue.

### Dominator Tree

This view displays the reference relationships between objects in the heap and identifies objects that occupy
the most memory. It helps find the objects with the highest memory usage and their reference chains, aiding in the
analysis and resolution of memory leak or high memory consumption issues.

### Histogram

This view displays the number of objects and memory usage for different classes in the heap. It helps understand
which classes occupy a significant amount of memory and guides memory optimization efforts.

### Threads

This view provides information about threads in the heap dump file. It displays thread states, stack
information, and related object references, aiding in the identification of thread issues and deadlock situations.

### Class Loaders

This view displays the classes loaded in the heap dump file and their relationships. It helps analyze
class loader-related issues and provides detailed information about the class loaders.

### OQL

OQL (Object Query Language) allows querying objects in the heap dump file using SQL-like syntax. It enables searching
for objects based on specific criteria, aiding in problem localization and analysis.

### GC Roots

This view displays the objects in the heap dump file that are considered as GC roots. These objects are the starting
points for active objects, and other objects are reachable through reference chains from them. GC Roots help identify
active objects and exclude unreachable objects.

### Direct Byte Buffers

This view displays the direct byte buffer objects in the heap dump file. Direct byte buffers are a special
type of buffer where the data is stored in memory outside the JVM heap, which can improve the efficiency of I/O
operations. This feature helps analyze and optimize the usage of direct byte buffers.

### Duplicated Classes

This view displays duplicate classes found in the heap dump file. These duplicate classes may
result in memory waste and performance issues related to class loading. This feature helps identify duplicate classes
and provides relevant information and suggestions to reduce memory consumption and optimize performance.

### Unreachable Objects

This view displays objects in the heap dump file that are unreachable. Unreachable objects are no
longer referenced by any active objects and may occupy memory but cannot be accessed. This feature helps identify
unreachable objects and facilitates the release of unused memory.

### System Properties

This view displays the system properties found in the heap dump file. It provides information about
JVM and system configurations, such as Java version, operating system, heap size, etc. This feature helps understand the
system environment and configuration information.
